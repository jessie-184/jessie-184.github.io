4. NMR INSTRUMENT

The NMR Instrument is a project which belongs to the Chemistry Department at Knox College. The project was established to help chemistry students have the most realistic view of how NMR instrument works. Users can use the touch screen to learn detailed information about the instrument as well as activate the LED lights installed inside of the instrument via the Raspberry Pi to highlight important parts involving in instrument operation.

5. SURVIVAL RUNNER

Survival Runner is a 2D platform game with pixel art style design. The game was developed by a 4-member team using C# and published on Unity Play. When playing, a player would have 3 lives and the mission is staying alive as long as possible while avoiding the obstacles with increasing difficulty levels.
