										It was a coincidence that I got into the technology industry. When I first entered college, I was prepared to pursue a pre-med program. However, my decision was completely changed when I took a computer science class. 
										My first computer science professor was my significant source of inspiration, sparking a passion in me that has only continued to intensify over time. As I delved into the world of coding and software development, 
										I was struck by the sheer brilliance of my peers and the rapid pace of innovation in the field. I was fascinated by the constant evolution of technology and the endless opportunities it presented for growth and learning.  
										As I navigated this new path, I discovered a sense of purpose and excitement that I hadn't experienced before, and I knew that I had made the right decision in pursuing a career in technology. 
										Since then, my journey has been marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge, a drive to stay at the forefront of industry trends, and a deep appreciation for the transformative power of technology to shape our world.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										It would be remiss of me not to mention my first group project. That was in the last semester of my second year, and I got a chance to get recruited to a team for the Knox College StartUp Term. 
										To talk about my background at that time, I had only taken 5 basic CS classes and only known Java, C# and Clojure. The project requires me to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My team only had 2 developers, 
										and I was the main one because the other programmer was quite busy managing members as a role of a team coordinator. It was tough for me because I had no choice but to learn those three languages quickly.
										With the ability to learn things quickly, I can be considered relatively proficient with 3 basic languages ​​in web programming after 5 days. At that time our team was building a Google Chrome extension product. 
										However, at the product publishing stage, our team encountered another difficulty due to policy changes and new rules requiring version 3 of the our software product. 
										That required me to conduct quick research on new and make some urgent changes in programming structure and algorithm within 4 days. After 10 weeks working hard together, we had our first launch to students at our school, 
										got voted for the most promising product, and achieved the Donald R. Stroben Entrepreneur Award to "support  entrepreneurship opportunities for students at Knox."
										<br/>
										<br/>
										That was truly a memorable milestone in this journey of mine because I realized my growth in many aspects. I felt very appreciative of my team members who recruited me to join the group 
										even though I didn't have much experience at that time compared to other seniors and juniors. When I asked what made them trust and choose me, they answered that I was someone who could learn extremely quickly. 
										Even if, at that time, they chose someone else with more experience, there would always be new knowledge that they didn't know for example the Google Chrome Extension V3 incident and it would be very time consuming 
										for the whole team to wait for someone to learn new things to find a solution while the group only had a limited time of 10 weeks. Besides, when talking to me, other team members felt very interested 
										because I brought a very new and positive energy to the whole team. They felt in me a strong passion and eagerness to learn. And it was that energy that made me connect with the whole team.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										After that, I had the opportunity to meet new people, gain more experience, learn a lot of new interesting things, and have opportunities to get involved in a lot of meaningful projects.
										I admit that when entering this area, I will encounter many difficult challenges. However, I am here to accept the challenge, and I am waiting for you to challenge me.
